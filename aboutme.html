<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The goal I am currently working towards in my personal life is to make more meaningful connections, and to become more reliable to those around me. While for my short term goals I would like to graduate high school. After graduating high school I would like to study I career which I believe would like and for it to pay me well, and I want to be successful in this career. What I need in order to achieve my success is to work harder than anyone else and to endure what challenges I face when achieving my goals. I most want to be known for being a hard-worker who is passionate about his work and is very ambitious and works towards to being successful.</p>
